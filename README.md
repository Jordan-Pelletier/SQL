# Jordan's SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.

## Introduction

In this portfolio, you will find a variety of SQL examples that I have written. These examples showcase my skills in database design, data modeling, and query optimization. I have included comments throughout the code to explain my thought process and reasoning behind each decision.
